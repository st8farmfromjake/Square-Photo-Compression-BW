# Square-Photo-Compression-BW
This projects main function is to use recursion techniques to compress a black and white square image to "save space". Photos must be 2^n x 2^n size to get the best results. Some other recursive methods are included.

 This project also has other simple features such as a pyramid builder, factorial summing function (ex: 8! + 7! +6!....0!), and a custom money game called MocsGame.

 MocsGame:
 Description: A game show has chosen you to be given a positive amount of money! The catch is you have to decide if it is possible too get to $42 dollars from the given amount of money, given the rules/choices you can make. If you guess correctly, you keep all the money.

 The rules are as followed:
 1. If the amount of money is divisible by 5:
      You can subtract exacly $42 from the total current amount
 2. If the amount of money is divisible by 4 OR 3:
      You subtract the last two digits of the total current amount times each other. (Ex: Total current amount: 333      3*3=9      333-9
 3. If the amount of money is divisible by 2:
      You divide the total current amount by 2
